       * By implementing this method, it is possible to perform custom
       * formatting on the field values, to set the cells stylesheets and to
       * control the display policy.
       * In addition, through a custom handler, it is possible to perform custom
       * display actions for the row, by directly acting on the DOM element
       * containing the grid row.
       * <BR>This event is also fired when a row is being removed from the grid,
       * to allow clearing actions related to custom display actions previously
       * performed for the row. Row removal may happen when the {@link DynaGrid}
       * is listening to events from {@link Subscription} instance(s), and the first
       * Subscription it listens to is a COMMAND Subscription;
       * removal may also happen in case of {@link AbstractWidget#removeRow} or
       * {@link AbstractWidget#clean} execution and in case of destruction of

       * <BR>This event is fired before the update is applied to both the HTML cells
       * of the grid and the internal model. As a consequence, through 
       * {@link AbstractWidget#updateRow}, it is still possible to modify the current update.
       * <BR>This notification is unrelated to paging activity. New or changed
       * rows are notified regardless that they are being shown in the current
       * page or that they are currently hidden. Also, no notifications are
       * available to signal that a row is entering or exiting the currently
       * displayed page.

       * added/removed/updated (keys are described in {@link AbstractWidget}).

       * updated values for all the cells, together with their display settings.
       * The desired settings can be set in the object, to substitute the default 
       * settings, before returning.
       * <BR>visualUpdate can also be null, to notify a clearing action.
       * In this case, the row is being removed from the page. 
       *   
       * @param {Object} domNode The DOM pointer to the HTML row involved.
       * The row element has been created by Lightstreamer, by cloning the
