/**
 * Class representing a device that supports Mobile Push Notifications (MPN).<BR>
 * It contains device details and the listener needed to monitor its status.<BR>
 * An MPN device is created from the application context, the sender ID (a.k.a. authorized entity) and a device token (a.k.a. registration token) obtained from 
 * Firebase Cloud Messaging APIs, and must be registered on the {@link LightstreamerClient} in order to successfully subscribe an MPN subscription. 
 * See {@link MpnSubscription}.<BR>
 * After creation, an MpnDevice object is in "unknown" state. It must then be passed to the Lightstreamer Server with the
 * {@link LightstreamerClient#registerForMpn(MpnDevice)} method, which enables the client to subscribe MPN subscriptions and sends the device details to the
 * server's MPN Module, where it is assigned a permanent device ID and its state is switched to "registered".<BR>
 * Upon registration on the server, active MPN subscriptions of the device are received and exposed with the {@link LightstreamerClient#getMpnSubscriptions(String)}
 * method.<BR>
 * An MpnDevice's state may become "suspended" if errors occur during push notification delivery. In this case MPN subscriptions stop sending notifications
 * and the device state is reset to "registered" at the first subsequent registration.
