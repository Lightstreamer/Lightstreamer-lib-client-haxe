/**
 * Class representing a Mobile Push Notifications (MPN) subscription to be submitted to the MPN Module of a Lightstreamer Server.<BR>
 * It contains subscription details and the listener needed to monitor its status. Real-time data is routed via native push notifications.<BR>
 * In order to successfully subscribe an MPN subscription, first an MpnDevice must be created and registered on the LightstreamerClient with
 * {@link LightstreamerClient#registerForMpn(MpnDevice)}.<BR>
 * After creation, an MpnSubscription object is in the "inactive" state. When an MpnSubscription object is subscribed to on an LightstreamerClient
 * object, through the {@link LightstreamerClient#subscribe(MpnSubscription, boolean)} method, its state switches to "active". This means that the subscription request
 * is being sent to the Lightstreamer Server. Once the server accepted the request, it begins to send real-time events via native push notifications and
 * the MpnSubscription object switches to the "subscribed" state.<BR>
 * If a trigger expression is set, the MPN subscription does not send any push notifications until the expression evaluates to true. When this happens,
 * the MPN subscription switches to "triggered" state and a single push notification is sent. Once triggered, no other push notifications are sent.<BR>
 * When an MpnSubscription is subscribed on the server, it acquires a permanent subscription ID that the server later uses to identify the same
 * MPN subscription on subsequent sessions.<BR>
 * An MpnSubscription can be configured to use either an Item Group or an Item List to specify the items to be subscribed to, and using either a Field Schema
 * or Field List to specify the fields. The same rules that apply to {@link Subscription} apply to MpnSubscription.<BR>
 * An MpnSubscription object can also be provided by the client to represent a pre-existing MPN subscription on the server. In fact, differently than real-time
 * subscriptions, MPN subscriptions are persisted on the server's MPN Module database and survive the session they were created on.<BR>
 * MPN subscriptions are associated with the MPN device, and after the device has been registered the client retrieves pre-existing MPN subscriptions from the
 * server's database and exposes them with the {@link LightstreamerClient#getMpnSubscriptions(String)} method.
