    /**
     * Creates an object to be used to describe an MPN subscription that is going to be subscribed to through the MPN Module of Lightstreamer Server.<BR>
     * The object can be supplied to {@link LightstreamerClient#subscribeMpn} in order to bring the MPN subscription to "active" state.<BR>
     * Note that all of the methods used to describe the subscription to the server can only be called while the instance is in the "inactive" state.
     *
     * <p>
     * Alternatively you can create an MpnSubscription object by passing a single argument either of type
     * <ul>
     * <li> {@link Subscription}: the new object is initialized by copying subscription mode, items, fields 
     * and data adapter from the specified real-time subscription; or</li>
     * <li> {@link MpnSubscription}: the new object is initialized by copying all properties from the specified MPN subscription.</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * @constructor
     * @exports MpnSubscription
     * 
     * @param {String} subscriptionMode The subscription mode for the items, required by Lightstreamer Server. Permitted values are:<ul>
     * <li><code>MERGE</code></li>
     * <li><code>DISTINCT</code></li>
     * </ul>
     * @param {String|String[]} items An array of items to be subscribed to through Lightstreamer Server. It is also possible specify the "Item List" or
     * "Item Group" later through {@link MpnSubscription#setItems} and {@link MpnSubscription#setItemGroup}.
     * @param {String[]} fields An array of fields for the items to be subscribed to through Lightstreamer Server. It is also possible to specify the "Field List" or
     * "Field Schema" later through {@link MpnSubscription#setFields} and {@link MpnSubscription#setFieldSchema}.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If no or invalid subscription mode is passed.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If either the items or the fields array is left null.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the specified "Item List" or "Field List" is not valid; see {@link MpnSubscription#setItems} and {@link MpnSubscription#setFields} for details.
     * 
     * @class Class representing a Web Push Notification subscription to be submitted to the MPN Module of a Lightstreamer Server.<BR>
     * It contains subscription details and the listener needed to monitor its status. Real-time data is routed via native push notifications.<BR>
     * In order to successfully subscribe an MPN subscription, first an MpnDevice must be created and registered on the LightstreamerClient with
     * {@link LightstreamerClient#registerForMpn}.<BR>
     * After creation, an MpnSubscription object is in the "inactive" state. When an MpnSubscription object is subscribed to on an LightstreamerClient
     * object, through the {@link LightstreamerClient#subscribeMpn} method, its state switches to "active". This means that the subscription request
     * is being sent to the Lightstreamer Server. Once the server accepted the request, it begins to send real-time events via native push notifications and
     * the MpnSubscription object switches to the "subscribed" state.<BR>
     * If a trigger expression is set, the MPN subscription does not send any push notifications until the expression evaluates to true. When this happens,
     * the MPN subscription switches to "triggered" state and a single push notification is sent. Once triggered, no other push notifications are sent.<BR>
     * When an MpnSubscription is subscribed on the server, it acquires a permanent subscription ID that the server later uses to identify the same
     * MPN subscription on subsequent sessions.<BR>
     * An MpnSubscription can be configured to use either an Item Group or an Item List to specify the items to be subscribed to, and using either a Field Schema
     * or Field List to specify the fields. The same rules that apply to {@link Subscription} apply to MpnSubscription.<BR>
     * An MpnSubscription object can also be provided by the client to represent a pre-existing MPN subscription on the server. In fact, differently than real-time
     * subscriptions, MPN subscriptions are persisted on the server's MPN Module database and survive the session they were created on.<BR>
     * MPN subscriptions are associated with the MPN device, and after the device has been registered the client retrieves pre-existing MPN subscriptions from the
     * server's database and exposes them with the {@link LightstreamerClient#getMpnSubscriptions} method.
