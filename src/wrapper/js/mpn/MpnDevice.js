  /**
	 * Creates an object to be used to describe an MPN device that is going to be registered to the MPN Module of Lightstreamer Server.<BR>
     * During creation the MpnDevice tries to acquires any previously registered device token from localStorage.
     * It then saves the current device token on localStorage. Saving and retrieving the previous device token is used to handle automatically
     * the cases where the token changes. The MPN Module of Lightstreamer Server is able to move
     * MPN subscriptions associated with the previous token to the new one.
     *
     * @constructor
     * @param {String} token the device token
     * @param {String} appId the application identifier
     * @param {String} platform either "Google" for Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or "Apple" for Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if <code>token</code> or <code>appId</code> is null or <code>platform</code> is not "Google" or "Apple".
     *
	 * @exports MpnDevice
	 *
	 * @class Class representing a device that supports Web Push Notifications.<BR>
	 * It contains device details and the listener needed to monitor its status.<BR>
	 * An MPN device is created from the application identifier, the platform and a device token (a.k.a. registration token) obtained from
	 * web push notifications APIs, and must be registered on the {@link LightstreamerClient} in order to successfully subscribe an MPN subscription.
	 * See {@link MpnSubscription}.<BR>
	 * After creation, an MpnDevice object is in "unknown" state. It must then be passed to the Lightstreamer Server with the
	 * {@link LightstreamerClient#registerForMpn} method, which enables the client to subscribe MPN subscriptions and sends the device details to the
	 * server's MPN Module, where it is assigned a permanent device ID and its state is switched to "registered".<BR>
	 * Upon registration on the server, active MPN subscriptions of the device are received and exposed with the {@link LightstreamerClient#getMpnSubscriptions}
	 * method.<BR>
	 * An MpnDevice's state may become "suspended" if errors occur during push notification delivery. In this case MPN subscriptions stop sending notifications
	 * and the device state is reset to "registered" at the first subsequent registration.
