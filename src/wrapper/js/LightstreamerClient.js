     * <BR>Upon subsequent calls to the method, the sequential management of

     * .
     * <BR>If a message, for any reason, doesn't reach the Server (this is possible with the HTTP transport),
     * it will be resent; however, this may cause the subsequent messages to be delayed.
     * For this reason, each message can specify a "delayTimeout", which is the longest time the message, after
     * reaching the Server, can be kept waiting if one of more preceding messages haven't been received yet.
     * If the "delayTimeout" expires, these preceding messages will be discarded; any discarded message
     * will be notified to the listener through {@link ClientMessageListener#onDiscarded}.
     * Note that, because of the parallel transport of the messages, if a zero or very low timeout is 
     * set for a message and the previous message was sent immediately before, it is possible that the
     * latter gets discarded even if no communication issues occur.
     * The Server may also enforce its own timeout on missing messages, to prevent keeping the subsequent
     * messages for long time.
     * <BR>Sequence identifiers can also be associated with the messages.
     * In this case, the sequential management is restricted to all subsets
     * of messages with the same sequence identifier associated.
     * <BR>Notifications of the operation outcome can be received by supplying
     * a suitable listener. The supplied listener is guaranteed to be eventually
     * invoked; listeners associated with a sequence are guaranteed to be invoked
     * sequentially.
     * <BR>The "UNORDERED_MESSAGES" sequence name has a special meaning.
     * For such a sequence, immediate processing is guaranteed, while strict
     * ordering and even sequentialization of the processing is not enforced.
     * Likewise, strict ordering of the notifications is not enforced.
     * However, messages that, for any reason, should fail to reach the Server
     * whereas subsequent messages had succeeded, might still be discarded after
     * a server-side timeout, in order to ensure that the listener eventually gets a notification.
     * <BR>Moreover, if "UNORDERED_MESSAGES" is used and no listener is supplied,
     * a "fire and forget" scenario is assumed. In this case, no checks on
     * missing, duplicated or overtaken messages are performed at all, so as to
     * optimize the processing and allow the highest possible throughput.
