    /**
     * Event handler that receives a notification each time the LightstreamerClient
     * status has changed. The status changes may be originated either by custom
     * actions (e.g. by calling {@link LightstreamerClient#disconnect}) or by
     * internal actions.
     * <BR/><BR/>The normal cases are the following:
     * <ul>
     * <li>After issuing connect(), if the current status is "DISCONNECTED*", the
     * client will switch to "CONNECTING" first and
     * to "CONNECTED:STREAM-SENSING" as soon as the pre-flight request receives its
     * answer.
     * <BR>As soon as the new session is established, it will switch to
     * "CONNECTED:WS-STREAMING" if the browser/environment permits WebSockets;
     * otherwise it will switch to "CONNECTED:HTTP-STREAMING" if the
     * browser/environment permits streaming or to "CONNECTED:HTTP-POLLING"
     * as a last resort.
     * <BR>On the other hand if the status is already "CONNECTED:*" a
     * switch to "CONNECTING" is usually not needed.</li>
     * <li>After issuing disconnect(), the status will switch to "DISCONNECTED".</li>
     * <li>In case of a server connection refusal, the status may switch from
     * "CONNECTING" directly to "DISCONNECTED". After that, the
     * {@link ClientListener#onServerError} event handler will be invoked.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <BR/>Possible special cases are the following:
     * <ul>
     * <li>In case of Server unavailability during streaming, the status may
     * switch from "CONNECTED:*-STREAMING" to "STALLED" (see
     * {@link ConnectionOptions#setStalledTimeout}).
     * If the unavailability ceases, the status will switch back to
     * ""CONNECTED:*-STREAMING"";
     * otherwise, if the unavailability persists (see
     * {@link ConnectionOptions#setReconnectTimeout}),
     * the status will switch to "DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY" and eventually to
     * "CONNECTED:*-STREAMING".</li>
     * <li>In case the connection or the whole session is forcibly closed
     * by the Server, the status may switch from "CONNECTED:*-STREAMING"
     * or "CONNECTED:*-POLLING" directly to "DISCONNECTED". After that, the
     * {@link ClientListener#onServerError} event handler will be invoked.</li>
     * <li>Depending on the setting in {@link ConnectionOptions#setSlowingEnabled},
     * in case of slow update processing, the status may switch from
     * "CONNECTED:WS-STREAMING" to "CONNECTED:WS-POLLING" or from
     * "CONNECTED:HTTP-STREAMING" to "CONNECTED:HTTP-POLLING".</li>
     * <li>If the status is "CONNECTED:*-POLLING" and any problem during an
     * intermediate poll occurs, the status may switch to "CONNECTING" and
     * eventually to "CONNECTED:*-POLLING". The same may hold for the
     * "CONNECTED:*-STREAMING" case, when a rebind is needed.</li>
     * <li>In case a forced transport was set through
     * {@link ConnectionOptions#setForcedTransport}, only the related final
     * status or statuses are possible. Note that if the transport is forced
     * while a Session is active and this requires a reconnection, the status
     * may do a preliminary switch to CONNECTED:STREAM-SENSING.</li>
     * <li>In case of connection problems, the status may switch from any value
     * to "DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY" (see {@link ConnectionOptions#setRetryDelay}),
     * then to "CONNECTING" and a new attempt will start.
     * However, in most cases, the client will try to recover the current session;
     * hence, the "DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY" status will be entered
     * and the recovery attempt will start.</li>
     * <li>In case of connection problems during a recovery attempt, the status may stay
     * in "DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY" for long time, while further attempts are made.
     * On the other hand, if the connection is successful, the status will do
     * a preliminary switch to CONNECTED:STREAM-SENSING. If the recovery is finally
     * unsuccessful, the current session will be abandoned and the status
     * will switch to "DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY" before the next attempts.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <BR>By setting a custom handler it is possible to perform
     * actions related to connection and disconnection occurrences. Note that
     * {@link LightstreamerClient#connect} and {@link LightstreamerClient#disconnect},
     * as any other method, can be issued directly from within a handler.
     *
     * @param {String} chngStatus The new status. It can be one of the
     * following values:
     * <ul>
     * <li>"CONNECTING" the client has started a connection attempt and is
     * waiting for a Server answer.</li>
     * <li>"CONNECTED:STREAM-SENSING" the client received a first response from
     * the server and is now evaluating if a streaming connection is fully
     * functional. </li>
     * <li>"CONNECTED:WS-STREAMING" a streaming connection over WebSocket has
     * been established.</li>
     * <li>"CONNECTED:HTTP-STREAMING" a streaming connection over HTTP has
     * been established.</li>
     * <li>"CONNECTED:WS-POLLING" a polling connection over WebSocket has
     * been started. Note that, unlike polling over HTTP, in this case only one
     * connection is actually opened (see {@link ConnectionOptions#setSlowingEnabled}).
     * </li>
     * <li>"CONNECTED:HTTP-POLLING" a polling connection over HTTP has
     * been started.</li>
     * <li>"STALLED" a streaming session has been silent for a while,
     * the status will eventually return to its previous CONNECTED:*-STREAMING
     * status or will switch to "DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY" / "DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY".</li>
     * <li>"DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY" a connection or connection attempt has been
     * closed; a new attempt will be performed (possibly after a timeout).</li>
     * <li>"DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY" a connection has been closed and
     * the client has started a connection attempt and is waiting for a Server answer;
     * if successful, the underlying session will be kept.</li>
     * <li>"DISCONNECTED" a connection or connection attempt has been closed. The
     * client will not connect anymore until a new {@link LightstreamerClient#connect}
     * call is issued.</li>
