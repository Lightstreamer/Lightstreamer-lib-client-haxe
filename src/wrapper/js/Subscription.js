/**
   * Creates an object to be used to describe a Subscription that is going
   * to be subscribed to through Lightstreamer Server.
   * The object can be supplied to {@link LightstreamerClient#subscribe} and
   * {@link LightstreamerClient#unsubscribe}, in order to bring the Subscription to
   * "active" or back to "inactive" state.
   * <BR>Note that all of the methods used to describe the subscription to the server
   * can only be called while the instance is in the "inactive" state; the only
   * exception is {@link Subscription#setRequestedMaxFrequency}.
   * @constructor
   * 
   * @exports Subscription
   * 
   * @throws {IllegalArgumentException} If no or invalid subscription mode is 
   * passed.
   * @throws {IllegalArgumentException} If the list of items is specified while
   * the list of fields is not, or viceversa.
   * @throws {IllegalArgumentException} If the specified "Item List" or "Field List"
   * is not valid; see {@link Subscription#setItems} and {@link Subscription#setFields} for details.
   *
   * @param {String} subscriptionMode the subscription mode for the
   * items, required by Lightstreamer Server. Permitted values are:
   * <ul>
   * <li>MERGE</li>
   * <li>DISTINCT</li>
   * <li>RAW</li>
   * <li>COMMAND</li>
   * </ul>
   * 
   * @param {String|String[]} [items] an array of Strings containing a list of items to
   * be subscribed to through the server. In case of a single-item subscription the String
   * containing the item name can be passed in place of the array; both of the 
   * following examples represent a valid subscription:
   * <BR><code>new Subscription(mode,"item1",fieldList);</code>
   * <BR><code>new Subscription(mode,["item1","item2"],fieldList);</code>
   * <BR>It is also possible to pass null (or nothing) and specify the
   * "Item List" or "Item Group" later through {@link Subscription#setItems} and
   * {@link Subscription#setItemGroup}. In this case the fields parameter must not be specified.
   
   * 
   * @param {String[]} [fields] An array of Strings containing a list of fields 
   * for the items to be subscribed to through Lightstreamer Server.
   * <BR>It is also possible to pass null (or nothing) and specify the
   * "Field List" or "Field Schema" later through {@link Subscription#setFields} and
   * {@link Subscription#setFieldSchema}. In this case the items parameter must not be specified.
   *
   * @class Class representing a Subscription to be submitted to a Lightstreamer
   * Server. It contains subscription details and the listeners needed to process the
   * real-time data. 
   * <BR>After the creation, a Subscription object is in the "inactive"
   * state. When a Subscription object is subscribed to on a {@link LightstreamerClient} 
   * object, through the {@link LightstreamerClient#subscribe} method, its state 
   * becomes "active". This means that the client activates a subscription to the 
   * required items through Lightstreamer Server and the Subscription object begins 
   * to receive real-time events.
   * 
   * <BR>A Subscritpion can be configured to use either an Item Group or an Item List to 
   * specify the items to be subscribed to and using either a Field Schema or Field List
   * to specify the fields.
   * <BR>"Item Group" and "Item List" are defined as follows:
   * <ul>
   * <li>"Item Group": an Item Group is a String identifier representing a list of items.
   * Such Item Group has to be expanded into a list of items by the getItems method of the
   * MetadataProvider of the associated Adapter Set. When using an Item Group, items in the 
   * subscription are identified by their 1-based index within the group.
   * <BR>It is possible to configure the Subscription to use an "Item Group" using the {@link Subscription#setItemGroup}
   * method.
   * </li> 
   * <li>"Item List": an Item List is an array of Strings each one representing an item.
   * For the Item List to be correctly interpreted a LiteralBasedProvider or a MetadataProvider
   * with a compatible implementation of getItems has to be configured in the associated Adapter Set.
   * <BR>Note that no item in the list can be empty, can contain spaces or can 
   * be a number. 
   * <BR>When using an Item List, items in the subscription are identified by their name or by
   * their 1-based index within the list.
   * <BR>It is possible to configure the Subscription to use an "Item List" using the {@link Subscription#setItems}
   * method or by specifying it in the constructor.
   * </li> 
   * </ul>
   * <BR>"Field Schema" and "Field List" are defined as follows:
   * <ul>
   * <li>"Field Schema": a Field Schema is a String identifier representing a list of fields.
   * Such Field Schema has to be expanded into a list of fields by the getFields method of the
   * MetadataProvider of the associated Adapter Set. When using a Field Schema, fields in the 
   * subscription are identified by their 1-based index within the schema.
   * <BR>It is possible to configure the Subscription to use a "Field Schema" using the {@link Subscription#setFieldSchema}
   * method.
   * </li>
   * <li>"Field List": a Field List is an array of Strings each one representing a field.
   * For the Field List to be correctly interpreted a LiteralBasedProvider or a MetadataProvider
   * with a compatible implementation of getFields has to be configured in the associated Adapter Set.
   * <BR>Note that no field in the list can be empty or can contain spaces. 
   * <BR>When using a Field List, fields in the subscription are identified by their name or by
   * their 1-based index within the list.
   * <BR>It is possible to configure the Subscription to use a "Field List" using the {@link Subscription#setFields}
   * method or by specifying it in the constructor.
