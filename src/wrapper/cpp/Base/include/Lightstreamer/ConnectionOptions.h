   * Note that the delay is calculated from the moment the effort to create a connection
   * is made, not from the moment the failure is detected.
   * As a consequence, when a working connection is interrupted, this timeout is usually
   * already consumed and the new attempt can be immediate (except that

   * or may resort to a polling connection.</li>
   * <li><i>Polling and pre-flight requests</i>: Applied on every connection. If after the timeout 
   * no data has arrived on the polling connection, the entire connection process restarts from scratch.</li>
