 /**
  * Class representing a Subscription to be submitted to a Lightstreamer Server. It contains 
  * subscription details and the listeners needed to process the real-time data. <BR>
  * After the creation, a Subscription object is in the "inactive" state. When a Subscription 
  * object is subscribed to on a LightstreamerClient object, through the 
  * {@link LightstreamerClient#subscribe(Subscription)} method, its state becomes "active". 
  * This means that the client activates a subscription to the required items through 
  * Lightstreamer Server and the Subscription object begins to receive real-time events. <BR>
  * A Subscription can be configured to use either an Item Group or an Item List to specify the 
  * items to be subscribed to and using either a Field Schema or Field List to specify the fields. <BR>
  * "Item Group" and "Item List" are defined as follows:
  * <ul>
  *  <li>"Item Group": an Item Group is a String identifier representing a list of items. 
  *  Such Item Group has to be expanded into a list of items by the getItems method of the 
  *  MetadataProvider of the associated Adapter Set. When using an Item Group, items in the 
  *  subscription are identified by their 1-based index within the group.<BR>
  *  It is possible to configure the Subscription to use an "Item Group" using the 
  *  {@link #setItemGroup(String)} method.</li> 
  *  <li>"Item List": an Item List is an array of Strings each one representing an item. 
  *  For the Item List to be correctly interpreted a LiteralBasedProvider or a MetadataProvider 
  *  with a compatible implementation of getItems has to be configured in the associated 
  *  Adapter Set.<BR>
  *  Note that no item in the list can be empty, can contain spaces or can be a number.<BR>
  *  When using an Item List, items in the subscription are identified by their name or 
  *  by their 1-based index within the list.<BR>
  *  It is possible to configure the Subscription to use an "Item List" using the 
  *  {@link #setItems(String[])} method or by specifying it in the constructor.</li>
  * </ul>
  * "Field Schema" and "Field List" are defined as follows:
  * <ul>
  *  <li>"Field Schema": a Field Schema is a String identifier representing a list of fields. 
  *  Such Field Schema has to be expanded into a list of fields by the getFields method of 
  *  the MetadataProvider of the associated Adapter Set. When using a Field Schema, fields 
  *  in the subscription are identified by their 1-based index within the schema.<BR>
  *  It is possible to configure the Subscription to use a "Field Schema" using the 
  *  {@link #setFieldSchema(String)} method.</li>
  *  <li>"Field List": a Field List is an array of Strings each one representing a field. 
  *  For the Field List to be correctly interpreted a LiteralBasedProvider or a MetadataProvider 
  *  with a compatible implementation of getFields has to be configured in the associated 
  *  Adapter Set.<BR>
  *  Note that no field in the list can be empty or can contain spaces.<BR>
  *  When using a Field List, fields in the subscription are identified by their name or 
  *  by their 1-based index within the list.<BR>
  *  It is possible to configure the Subscription to use a "Field List" using the 
  *  {@link #setFields(String[])} method or by specifying it in the constructor.</li>
