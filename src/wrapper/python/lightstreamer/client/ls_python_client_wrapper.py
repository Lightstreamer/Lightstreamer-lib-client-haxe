 However, you should be aware that the event notifications are dispatched by a single thread, the so-called event thread. 
 This means that if the operations of a listener are slow or blocking, they will delay the processing of the other listeners and 
 affect the performance of your application. 
 Therefore, you should delegate any slow or blocking operations to a dedicated thread, and keep the listener methods as fast and simple as possible.

   to be invoked sequentially. 

   The "UNORDERED_MESSAGES" sequence name has a special meaning. For such a sequence, immediate processing 
   is guaranteed, while strict ordering and even sequentialization of the processing is not enforced. 
   Likewise, strict ordering of the notifications is not enforced. However, messages that, for any reason, 
   should fail to reach the Server whereas subsequent messages had succeeded, might still be discarded after 
   a server-side timeout, in order to ensure that the listener eventually gets a notification.

   Moreover, if "UNORDERED_MESSAGES" is used and no listener is supplied, a "fire and forget" scenario
   is assumed. In this case, no checks on missing, duplicated or overtaken messages are performed at all,
   so as to optimize the processing and allow the highest possible throughput.
   
   **lifecycle** Since a message is handled by the Metadata Adapter associated to the current connection, a
   message can be sent only if a connection is currently active. If the special enqueueWhileDisconnected 
   flag is specified it is possible to call the method at any time and the client will take care of sending
   the message as soon as a connection is available, otherwise, if the current status is "DISCONNECTED*", 
   the message will be abandoned and the :meth:`.ClientMessageListener.onAbort` event will be fired. 

   Note that, in any case, as soon as the status switches again to "DISCONNECTED*", any message still pending 
   is aborted, including messages that were queued with the enqueueWhileDisconnected flag set to true. 

   Also note that forwarding of the message to the server is made in a separate thread, hence, if a message 
   is sent while the connection is active, it could be aborted because of a subsequent disconnection. 
   In the same way a message sent while the connection is not active might be sent because of a subsequent
   connection.
   
   :param message: a text message, whose interpretation is entirely demanded to the Metadata Adapter associated to the current connection.
   :param sequence: an alphanumeric identifier, used to identify a subset of messages to be managed in sequence; underscore characters are also allowed. If the "UNORDERED_MESSAGES" identifier is supplied, the message will be processed in the special way described above. The parameter is optional; if set to None, "UNORDERED_MESSAGES" is used as the sequence name. 
   :param delayTimeout: a timeout, expressed in milliseconds. If higher than the Server configured timeout on missing messages, the latter will be used instead. The parameter is optional; if a negative value is supplied, the Server configured timeout on missing messages will be applied. This timeout is ignored for the special "UNORDERED_MESSAGES" sequence, although a server-side timeout on missing messages still applies.
   :param listener: an object suitable for receiving notifications about the processing outcome. The parameter is optional; if not supplied, no notification will be available.
   :param enqueueWhileDisconnected: if this flag is set to true, and the client is in a disconnected status when the provided message is handled, then the message is not aborted right away but is queued waiting for a new session. Note that the message can still be aborted later when a new session is established.

After the creation, a Subscription object is in the "inactive" state. When a Subscription object is subscribed to on a LightstreamerClient object, through the :meth:`LightstreamerClient.subscribe` method, its state becomes "active". 
This means that the client activates a subscription to the required items through 
Lightstreamer Server and the Subscription object begins to receive real-time events. 

A Subscription can be configured to use either an Item Group or an Item List to specify the 
items to be subscribed to and using either a Field Schema or Field List to specify the fields. 

"Item Group" and "Item List" are defined as follows:
  
   * "Item Group": an Item Group is a String identifier representing a list of items. Such Item Group has to be expanded into a list of items by the getItems method of the MetadataProvider of the associated Adapter Set. When using an Item Group, items in the subscription are identified by their 1-based index within the group. It is possible to configure the Subscription to use an "Item Group" using the :meth:`setItemGroup` method. 
   * "Item List": an Item List is an array of Strings each one representing an item. For the Item List to be correctly interpreted a LiteralBasedProvider or a MetadataProvider with a compatible implementation of getItems has to be configured in the associated Adapter Set. Note that no item in the list can be empty, can contain spaces or can be a number. When using an Item List, items in the subscription are identified by their name or by their 1-based index within the list. It is possible to configure the Subscription to use an "Item List" using the :meth:`setItems` method or by specifying it in the constructor.
  
"Field Schema" and "Field List" are defined as follows:
  
   * "Field Schema": a Field Schema is a String identifier representing a list of fields. Such Field Schema has to be expanded into a list of fields by the getFields method of the MetadataProvider of the associated Adapter Set. When using a Field Schema, fields in the subscription are identified by their 1-based index within the schema. It is possible to configure the Subscription to use a "Field Schema" using the :meth:`setFieldSchema` method.
   * "Field List": a Field List is an array of Strings each one representing a field. For the Field List to be correctly interpreted a LiteralBasedProvider or a MetadataProvider with a compatible implementation of getFields has to be configured in the associated Adapter Set. Note that no field in the list can be empty or can contain spaces. When using a Field List, fields in the subscription are identified by their name or by their 1-based index within the list. It is possible to configure the Subscription to use a "Field List" using the :meth:`setFields` method or by specifying it in the constructor.
  
A Subscription can be supplied to :meth:`LightstreamerClient.subscribe` and :meth:`LightstreamerClient.unsubscribe`, in order to bring the Subscription to "active" or back to "inactive" state.
